          web UI directly.
        + Fail2ban now works on OpenBSD.
        + Track last login of both POP3/IMAP logins.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Use 'pspell' spell check engine instead of default 'googie' which
          sends data to Roundcube website.
        - Not install package `libclamunrar9` for unpacking rar file on Ubuntu.
        - installer: not correctly update allowed_clients in php-fpm pool
          config file for FreeBSD Jail.
        - Amavisd can not store mail subject with emoji characters.

    * Improvements:
        - tools/backup_*.sh: do not rely on Python to calculate dates.

    * Fixed issues:
        - PostgreSQL backend: improper index for table `vmail.sender_relayhost`.
        - LDAP backend: improper filter which causes missing external members
          while querying (not-subscribeable) mailing list with alias domain.
          Thanks to Alyssa Hullinger for the report.
        - Backup MX doesn't work.
        - rsyslog config file `/etc/rsyslog.d/1-iredmail-iredapd.conf` doesn't
          work on CentOS.
        - Installer:
            - Not enable IPv6 in Nginx.
            - Not disable checks for energid in netdata.
              Port 9998 is used by Amavisd and energid (not installed by
              iRedMail) by default, netdata will try to send http request to
              this port, hence it causes error message in Amavisd log file each
              time netdata starts.
            - Not correctly set Nginx log file path in Fail2ban.
            - Not set message size limit in Roundcube ($config['max_message_size']).
            - Not remove `!SSLv2` in Dovecot on Ubuntu 18.04.

    * Improvements:
        - Netdata: Replace few Python modules by Go modules to collect data
          for better performance.
        - Disable email notification since netdata is too sensitive and the
          notification message is "useless".

            latest LTS edition will be supported.

    * Drop support for OpenBSD ldapd backend.
    * Improvements:
        + Dovecot:

            - Enable tracking user loast login time by default for
              MySQL/MariaDB and OpenLDAP backends.
              Note: Dovecot doesn't support this with PostgreSQL yet.

        + netdata: Disable sending anonymous statistics to netdata cloud.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Improper order of restriction rules in Postfix
          `smtpd_sender_restrictions` setting.

        - Loose Fail2ban filter rules (postfix/dovecot) to reduce negative bans.
        - [Linux] Not send kill signal to php-fpm daemon process to reopen log
          file after logrotation.
        - tools/create_mail_user_OpenLDAP.py:
            - Fix missing comma which causes incorrect value of
              ldap attribute 'enabledService'.
              Thanks Michael Chong.

          (was /var/log/openldap.log).

    * Fixed issues:
        - Not correctly generate/update firewall rules if ssh is listening on
          2 network ports.
        - Not index ldap attribute `mobile`.
        - Not always specify a plain text footer file for altermime to update
          email sent to mlmmj mailing list.

    * Remove components:
        - Apache has been removed, Nginx is the only one web server available.

    * New components:
        + netdata (1.10.0) monitor integration: http://my-netdata.io
          Note: netdata currently works on Linux and FreeBSD, not OpenBSD.

          - Integrate netdata on Linux server:
            https://docs.iredmail.org/integration.netdata.linux.html

    * Improvements:
        - SQL backends:
            - New table: maillists.
            - New columns: domain.maillists, forwardings.is_maillist.
            - Removed column: mailbox.local_part.
              It's inherited from PostfixAdmin at the beginning, but not used

        - tools/backup_sogo.sh
            - Not set correct owner and permission on backup files.
            - Cannot remove old backup files.
        - tools/backup_openldap.sh:

              Note: backup is fine, just no log in SQL db.
              Thanks swejun <ingvar _at_ zebware.com> for the feedback and fix
              in forum.
        - tools/create_mail_user_*:
            - Not use current date as password last change date for newly
              created user.
        - tools/migrate_sql_alias_table.py:
            - Doesn't support 'utf8' charset.
              Thanks Kacper Guzik <kacper.guzik _at_ zenbox _dot_ pl> for the
              report and code contribution.

    * Updated packages:

        + uwsgi -> 2.0.17 (OpenBSD only)
        + SOGo -> 4.0 (switched yum/apt repo to SOGo v4 nightly builds)

iRedMail-0.9.7:
    * Supports new distribution release:
        + OpenBSD 6.1. OpenBSD 6.0 is not supported anymore.
        + Ubuntu 17.04. Ubuntu 16.10 is not supported anymore.
        + Debian 9 (code name: stretch). Tested with Debian 9 RC3.

    * Improvements:
        - SQL structure change (for SQL backends): drop few columns in sql
          table `vmail.alias`, and creates 2 new tables: forwardings,
          alias_moderators. For more technical details, please check this issue:
          https://bitbucket.org/zhb/iredmail/issues/101

        - SOGo:
            + New script 'tools/backup_sogo.sh'. used to backs up SOGo data
              with 'sogo-tool backup' command.

        - Fail2ban:
            + Add one new regular expession to filter Roundcube log.
            + Enable 2 new jails: apache-auth, nginx-http-auth.
            + Split jail.local to multiple modular jail config files under
              /etc/fail2ban/jail.d.

        - Nginx: Use different directories to store different type of config
          files for easier customization.
            - /etc/nginx/conf.d/ - store configurations used inside 'http {}'
            - /etc/nginx/sites-available/ - store config files for web sites.
              All files under this directory are NOT loaded by default.
            - /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ - store config files for web sites.
              All files under this directory will be loaded by default.
              Usually file under this directory is a symbol link to file under
              /etc/nginx/sites-available/. This way we can easily enable or
              disable a site without renaming or moving its config file.
            - /etc/nginx/sites-conf.d/ - store per-site modular config files.
              for example, for web domain 'iredmail.org', we use directory
              '/etc/nginx/sites-conf.d/iredmail.org/' to store modular config
              files for all its http settings, and
              '/etc/nginx/sites-conf.d/iredmail.org-ssl/' for all https
              settings. You can use a prefixed digital number or letter to
              define the order of config files loaded by Nginx. For example,
              '00-listen.conf' will be loaded before other files.

              NOTE: of course you're not forced to use this directory, and
              you're free to write all settings in one file like
              '/etc/nginx/sites-available/<site>.conf'. it's just a different
              way (which we think it's better) to manage per-site settings.

              Examples:

              - sites-conf.d/iredmail.org/server_name.conf: define the server
                name ('server_name iredmail.org;')
              - sites-conf.d/iredmail.org/listen.conf: define the listen port
                ('port 80;').
              - sites-conf.d/iredmail.org/root.conf: define the document root
                directory ('root /var/www/vhosts/iredmail.org;')

        - Generate /root/.my.cnf-<sql-user>:
            - /root/my.cnf-vmail
            - /root/my.cnf-vmailadmin
            - /root/my.cnf-amavisd
            - /root/my.cnf-iredapd
            - /root/my.cnf-iredadmin
            - /root/my.cnf-sogo
            - /root/my.cnf-roundcube
    * Fixed issues:
        - Enable 'iterate_query =' in 'dovecot-mysql.conf', so that doveadm
          works fine if it needs to get all mail users.
        - Not enable cron job for iRedAdmin script: tools/delete_mailboxes.py.
          Thanks sergiocesar <sergio _at_ winc.net> for the report.
        - tools/backup_mysql.sh: Backup sql databases with mysqldump option
          '--skip-comments' to avoid possible backdooring hack.
          FYI: https://blog.tarq.io/cve-2016-5483-backdooring-mysqldump-backups/
        - FreeBSD:
            - installing port 'archives/arj' interrupts iRedMail installation.
              This is caused by global variable 'LANGUAGE=C'.
            - Cannot reset MySQL (5.7) password.

    * Updated packages:
        + iRedAPD -> 2.1
        + iRedAdmin -> 0.8
        + Roundcube -> 1.3.0

        + OpenBSD 6.0. OpenBSD 5.9 is not supported anymore.
        + FreeBSD 11.0.
        + Ubuntu 16.10. WARNING: Ubuntu 16.10 will end of life in July 2017,
          Ubuntu 16.04 LTS edition is recommended for a production server.

    * Improvements:
        - Use rsyslog (requires version 8.x) instead of internal logging system
          for Dovecot on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04, 16.10.

          rsyslog is default syslog program on CentOS, Debian and Ubuntu.
          With rsyslog, we're able to discard log messages which matches
          given regular expressions if it produces too fast. for example,
          HAProxy performs health check every few seconds for POP3/IMAP (and
          other) services, we can easily discard those health check related
          logs to save disk space.

        - Switch Awstats user authentication from SQL/LDAP to basic auth based
          on file, Awstats is now available for both Apache and Nginx.
        - Installer:
            + Able to choose not to install web server and web applications.

        - Nginx:
            - Add HSTS header for Roundcube, iRedAdmin, SOGo.
            - Add sample config files to run Roundcube, iRedAdmin, SOGo as a
              subdomain.

        - Roundcube webmail:
            - Enable plugin `enigma` by default for PGP encryption.
              WARNING: The plugin uses gpg binary on the server and stores all
              keys (including private keys of the users) on the server.
              Encryption/decryption is done server-side. So, this plugin
              is for users that trust the server.

              If you get error `Identity must have a user name defined` while
              first trying to generate gpg key, please add a name for your
              email account in Roundcube: `Settings -> Identities`.

        - SOGo:
            - List all contacts by default in SOGo global address book.

        - FreeBSD:
            - Switch from OpenSSL to LibreSSL by default.

    * Fixed issues:
        - LDAP backends: mail accounts (user, alias, list) are still active
          when domain is disabled.
        - Fix the HTTPROXY vulnerability in Apache and Nginx.
          Reference: https://httpoxy.org/
        - Not convert domain name and email address to lower cases while
          creating mail accounts with scripts tools/create_mail_user_*.
          Thanks Santosh Gupta <head.it _at_ satmatechnologies.com> for the
          report.

        - SOGo:
            - Not correctly redirect access to https in Apache.

        - Postfix:
            - Not enable opportunistic TLS support for remote smtp clients.
            - Incorrect HELO restriction rule which causes Postfix rejects smtp
              session with HELO "[IP_ADDRESS]" (with squared brackets).

        - Nginx:
            - Not allow access to '/.well-known/'.
            - Not forward real client IP address to SOGo.

              renamed to `00-default.conf`, to make sure it will be loaded
              before other virtual host config files.

        - Roundcube webmail:
            - Missing cron job used to clean up old Roundcube temporary files
              (bin/gc.sh).
            - Not set proper file owner (apache/nginx) and permission (0600)
              for config file of password plugin.

        - iRedAPD:
            - Not add FreeBSD Jail IP address as trusted client. This causes
              mail delivery failure while sending to user under same domain.
              Thanks Erez Zabusky <erez_z _at_ cre8ip.com> for the report.

        - OpenBSD:
            - not enable uwsgi service.
            - not create symbol links for PHP programs.

    * Updated packages:
        + Roundcube -> 1.2.3
        + iRedAPD -> 2.0

        + Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (code name: xenial).
        + OpenBSD 5.9.

    * Drop support for old distribution releases:
        - Ubuntu 15.10 (code name: wily).
        - OpenBSD 5.8.
        - Debian 7 (code name: Wheezy). Please use Debian 8 instead.

          Debian team stops offering security updates for Debian 7 after
          April 25, 2016. Reference: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianOldStable

    * Improvements:
        - Postfix:
            + Supports Postfix parameter `sender_dependent_relayhost_maps`.
            + SMTP SASL AUTH is disabled on port 25. Please use port 587 instead.

            + Add custom Amavisd log template (at log level 0) to always log
              SpamAssassin testing result.
        - OpenLDAP:
            + Switch OpenLDAP backend to mdb (Memory-Mapped DB backend to slapd)
              on Linux and FreeBSD (not available on OpenBSD yet).
            + Enable OpenLDAP overlay 'pw-sha2' to support password verification
              with sha2 algorithms.
        - SOGo:
            + SOGo is configured to store password in SSHA512 (instead of ssha)
              hash by default.
            + Switch SOGo to 3.x from 2.x on Linux/FreeBSD (OpenBSD offers v2).
            + Able to enable/disable sogo service for a single user with new SQL
              column `mailbox.enablesogo` and LDAP attribute/value
              `enabledService=sogo`.
        - OpenBSD ldapd(8):
            + Add script and daily cron job to backup ldapd.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Not correctly setup Fail2ban jail `action=` setting to block bad ssh
          client IP address.
        - Improper proxy timeout setting in SOGo and Nginx which cause SOGo
          error 'client disconnected during delivery of response'.
        - Not correctly add Postfix alias 'virusalert: root' for
          non-(Debian/Ubuntu) OSes.
        - Not create directory used to store php session files.
        - Not enable cron job to auto update SpamAssassin rules on RHEL/CentOS.

    * Updated packages:
        + Roundcube webmail -> 1.1.5
        + iRedAdmin -> 0.6
        + iRedAPD -> 1.9.0

iRedMail-0.9.4:
    * New scripts:
        - tools/fail2ban_unban_ip.sh. Used to unban specified IP addresses
          from ALL fail2ban jails.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Not enable port 25 in OpenBSD PF rule.
        - Not detect IPv6 support on server.
        - Not correct set file permission of /etc/mail/mailer.conf on FreeBSD.
        - Not install port 'www/sogo-activesync' on FreeBSD.
        - Installation inside FreeBSD Jail:
            - Not correctly set MySQL/PostgreSQL/SOGo/Amavisd bind addresses.
            - Not updating Postfix `mynetworks=` to use specified local
              address.
              Thanks Peter2121 <peter _at_ flytrace.com> for the report in forum.
        - Use only 2 DNSBL services in postscreen service:
          zen.spamhaus.org, b.barracudacentral.org.
        - Cannot use specified MySQL root password on command line while
          installing with remote MySQL server.

iRedMail-0.9.3:
    * Works on new distribution releases:
        - Ubuntu 15.10. [Note: old 15.04 is not supported.]
        - OpenBSD 5.8. Notes:
            + 5.7 and earlier releases are not supported.
            + spamd(8) is not enabled and replaced by postscreen, because
              postscreen is better to reduce spam (e.g. with help of DNSBL
              services).

    * Remove components:
        - Cluebringer has been removed. It's not under active development and
          no new release since 2013 (the latest stable release doesn't support
          IPv6), we have greylisting and throttling support in iRedAPD as
          replacement.

    * Improvements:
        - SOGo Groupware is now available on FreeBSD.
        - Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) in both Apache and Nginx.
        - Update Fail2ban filter to catch postscreen log.
        - Enable global address book for SQL backends in SOGo by default,
          domains are isolated. Thanks dnwahs <shawn _at_ mcsp.net> for the
          sharing in iRedMail forum.
        - Supports per-user alias address in SQL backends. 2 new sql columns
          are required: `alias.is_alias`, `alias.alias_to`.
        - Enable postscreen service in Postfix by default.
          Important Note: all users must use port 587 for sending email, port
          25 doesn't accept submitted mail by authenticated users anymore.
        - New SQL table `amavisd.outbound_wblist`, used to store whitelists
          and blacklists for outbound messages. It's required by iRedAPD
          plugin 'amavisd_wblist'.

    * New scripts:
        - tools/ldap_assign_user_to_groups.py. Used to assign user to specified
          mailing lists, or remove membership.
        - tools/ldap_move_members_to_another_group.py. Used to move or copy ALL
          members of specified mailing list to another.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Key length 2048 of DKIM key is too long, too many complains because
          many DNS vendors don't support it. So we generate with 1024 instead.
        - Not add 'virusalert' in Postfix alias file.
        - Not use correct postrotate command to rotate log file on Debian.
        - Incorrectly set default fireewall zone on RHEL/CentOS 7 if you
          didn't choose to restart firewall immediately.
        - 'daemonze =' is required by RHEL/CentOS v6, but not v7.
        - Incorrect Dovecot Master User account used by SOGo.
        - Dovecot Master User doesn't work with LDAP backend.
        - Incorrect quota warning priorities in Dovecot.
          Thanks Peter <rs _at_ samplezone.ch> for the feedback.
        - Incorrect Amavisd setting to sign DKIM on inbound messages.
        - [RHEL/CentOS] Cannot start uwsgi service with 'daemonize' setting in
          /etc/uwsgi.ini.
        - Not preserve the case of ${extension} while delivering message to
          mailbox.

    * Updated packages:
        + Roundcube webmail -> 1.1.3.
        + uwsgi -> 2.0.11.2 (OpenBSD only)
        + iRedAPD -> 1.7.0
        + iRedAdmin -> 0.4.3
        + FreeBSD:
            - php-5.6

iRedMail-0.9.2:
    * SOGo now works on Debian 8.
    * Improvements:
        - LMTP (port 24) and managesieve (port 4190) services are now listening
          on only localhost (127.0.0,1 and ::1) by default.
        - Improve Fail2ban filter `postfix.iredmail.conf` to prevent DoS
          attack to SMTP service.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Cannot create required SQL tables in `vmail` database with PostgreSQL
          backend.
        - catch-all support doesn't work with user+extension@domain.com.
          Thanks to stevekez <iredmail@stevekerrison.com> for the contribution
          in iRedMail support forum.
        - uwsgi service doesn't work on RHEL/CentOS. A new version of uwsgi
          package was submitted to EPEL repo with higher priority (not
          submitted by iRedMail team), it's not compatible with settings
          configured by iRedMail, this causes uwsgi service cannot be started.
        - Cannot import MySQL database on Jailed FreeBSD.
        - Not install required port 'databases/py-sqlalchemy' on FreeBSD.
        - Fix 'The Logjam Attack' ssl related issue. Reference:
          https://weakdh.org/

    * Updated packages:
        + iRedAPD -> 1.6.0, bug fixes.

iRedMail-0.9.1:
    * Works on new distribution releases:
        - Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04. Notes:
            o Roundcube and iRedAdmin are now stored under /opt/www.
            o Cluebringer is not installed due to package missing in official
              repo, that means your server doesn't support greylisting and
              throttling.
            o SOGo is not installed due to package missing in upstream (SOGo)
              repo.

        - OpenBSd 5.7. Notes:
            o No official MySQL binary packages, so please use MariaDB instead.

    * Drop support for old distribution releases:
        - Ubuntu 12.04, 14.10. Please use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or 15.04 instead.

    * Improvements:
        - Log most terminal output of iRedMail installation to file
          'runtime/install.log', used for troubleshooting after installation.
        - Backup scripts are able to delete old backup copies. Default setting
          is keeping backup copies for 90 days.
        - [LDAP] Allow mailing list account to use attributes: gidNumber,
          memberUid.
        - Don't install both Apache and Nginx, just one of them.

          Debian/Ubuntu package maintainer over-designed the post-install
          script, it will restart service after package installed, if we have
          both installed, installing another one will fail, because network
          ports are used by the first one.

          Same reason as above, if we have both installed, upgrading both of
          them will trigger service restarting too. This may cause the
          currently running web service cannot start.

        - Make Dovecot subscribe newly created folder automatically.
          Thanks Michael Telatynski <postmaster _at_ webdevguru.co.uk> for the
          patch.
        - Able to restrict user to login for specified IP addresses or
          networks, multiple IP addresses or networks must be separated by
          comma.

          o LDAP: IP addresses or networks must be listed in attribute
                  `allowNets` in user object.
          o SQL: IP addresses or networks must be listed in SQL column
                  `mailbox.allow_nets`.

        - Bypass greylisting for some big ISPs
          (samples/cluebringer/greylisting-whitelist.sql).
        - Setup Fail2ban to monitor SOGo log file.
        - Add two new Fail2ban filters to help catch spam.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Amavisd cannot ban zipped '.exe' file on RHEL/CentOS.
        - Install package `unrar` as rar unarchiver on RHEL/CentOS/Debian/Ubuntu.
        - Incorrect log file and owner/group in /etc/logrotate.d/policyd.
        - Cannot send email to user+ext@domain.com when per-domain catch-all
          is enabled. Note: not fixed with LDAP backend yet.
        - Cannot send mail with Roundcube and PHP 5.6.
        - Cannot run PHP scripts under web document root with Nginx.
        - Not use user's identity as envelope sender for 'return receipt'
          responses.
        - Not backup SOGo SQL database.
        - Incorrect path of command 'sogo-tool' on OpenBSD.
        - Not apply service restriction in Dovecot SQL query file while acting
          as SASL server.

    * Updated packages:
        + Roundcube webmail -> 1.1.1
        + uwsgi -> 2.0.10. OpenBSD only.
        + iRedAdmin -> 0.4.2 (open source edition).
        + iRedAPD -> 1.5.0.

    * Known issues:
        + OpenLDAP backend:
            - if you have catch-all account enabled for mail domain, email
              sent to user+extension@domain.com will be delivered to catch-all
              account.

iRedMail-0.9.0:
    * Works on new distribution releases:
        - RHEL/CentOS 7
        - Ubuntu 14.10 (codename: utopic)
        - OpenBSD 5.6. Note: Nginx is used as web server, the new built-in
          httpd daemon (not Apache-1.3) is not used.

    * SOGo groupware integration:

      SOGo groupware provides a rich AJAX-based Web interface and supports
      multiple native clients through the use of standard protocols such as
      CalDAV, CardDAV and GroupDAV, as well as Microsoft ActiveSync.
      Check its website for more details: http://sogo.nu/

      Important notes of SOGo integration in iRedMail:

      o SOGo integration is available on below Linux distributions and releases:

        - RHEL/CentOS 6. SOGo project doesn't provide RPMs for CentOS 7 yet.
        - Debian 7.
        - Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. No official packages for 14.10 yet.
        - OpenBSD 5.6.

      o Full/native Exchange protocol support requires OpenChange and Samba4,
        but they're not integrated in iRedMail, so iRedMail-0.9.0 doesn't
        provide full/native support for Microsoft Outlook clients, Apple
        Mail.app and iOS devices. BlackBerry 10 works fine.

        Check our tutorial to setup your mail clients:
        http://www.iredmail.org/docs/index.html#configure-mail-client-applications

      o If you choose to install both Roundcube webmail and SOGo, Managesieve
        service is disabled in SOGo by default, because sieve rules generated
        by SOGo is not compatible with Roundcube webmail. but if you don't
        install Roundcube, managesieve will be enabled in SOGo by default, plus
        vacation and forwarding support.

      o User cannot change password with PostgreSQL backend.

    * Improvements:
        - Nginx support is now available on all Linux/BSD distributions.

          If you choose to use Nginx as default web server, both Awstats and
          Cluebringer are not accessible, because Nginx doesn't have official
          SQL/LDAP auth modules. You have to switch to Apache instead, and
          reset mail user password to MD5.

        - MariaDB support is now available on FreeBSD.
        - Add new index for SQL column 'msgs.spam_level' in 'amavisd' database.
        - With MySQL/PostgreSQL backends, password hash is now SSHA512 by
          default password on Linux, and BCRYPT on FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
          Both Roundcube password plugin and iRedAdmin support them.

          if you want to login to Awstats/Cluebringer, you have to reset mail
          user password to MD5 since Apache sql/ldap auth doesn't support
          SSHA512/BCRYPT.

        - Enable global sieve script in Dovecot to move spam to Junk folder by
          default.
        - Disable SSLv3 in Postfix, Dovecot, Apache, Nginx.
        - Backup scripts will log backup status in SQL table `iredadmin`, so
          that admin can easily check backup status with iRedAdmin.
        - Enable '@lookup_sql_dsn' in Amavisd by default, used for
          per-recipient lookup policy, including white/blacklist, spam policy,
          incoming message size limit.
        - New index in `amavisd` database for SQL column `policy.policy_name`.
          Required by iRedAdmin-Pro self-service.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Replace mod_auth_mysql/pgsql by apr-util-mysql/pgsql for Awstats
          and Cluebringer webui user authentication on Debian/Ubuntu.
        - Not enable cron job to update SpamAssassin rules in file
          /etc/default/spamassassin (CRON=1) on Debian/Ubuntu.
        - Incorrect quota dict name in Dovecot quota warning script.
        - Decrease number of pre-forked Amavisd processes ($max_servers) to 4
          by default to reduce memory usage.
        - Add missing SQL column (mailbox.enableindexer-worker) and LDAP
          attribute/value pair: enabledService=indexer-worker. Required by
          Dovecot.
          Thanks dwbotsch <botsch _at_ cnf.cornell.edu> for the report.

    * Updated packages:
        + Roundcube webmail -> 1.0.4
        + iRedAPD -> 1.4.4. 3 new plugins, bug fixes, performance improvements.
        + iRedAdmin -> 0.4.1. New tool scripts, fixes several issues.

    * FreeBSD ports of major component:
        o Apache: www/apache24
        o PHP: lang/php55
        o MySQL: databases/mysql56-server
        o MariaDB: databases/mariadb55-server
        o PostgreSQL: databases/postgresql93-server

    * Below packages are removed from iRedMail due to security concern:
        - phpMyAdmin
        - phpPgAdmin
        - phpLDAPadmin

      If you need a sql management tool, please try http://adminer.org/

      to change, useful for large-scale deployment. e.g.:
        Your mail data are all stored in /home/vmail01, but disk storage is
        nearly full, it's easy to make new users use new storage like
        /home/vmail02, /home/vmail03 or whatever:
            - Prevous maildir: /home/vmail01/z/zh/zha/zhang/
            - Current maildir: /home/vmail02/h/hu/hua/huang/
      You can set the storage base directory in either MySQL (column:
      vmail.storagebasedirectory) or OpenLDAP backend (attribute:
      storageBaseDirectory).

      In addition, maildir and user's HOME directory are seperated (maildir
      is $HOME/Maildir/ by default), so that you can integrate more
      applications against LDAP user auth like OpenSSH, FTP service, SugarCRM
      or whatever you want, data stored in disk storage of each service will
      not be mixed.
    * Add group 'all@domain.ltd' by default for ldap solution.
    * Add 'enabledService=displayedInGlobalAddressBook' for ldap solution,
      used to control mail address displayed in global ldap address book or
